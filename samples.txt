Mira lived in a quiet village at the edge of an ancient forest. One evening, she found a glowing blue feather lying on the path near her home. When she picked it up, the trees around her began to shimmer as if waking from a long sleep. Suddenly, a small silver fox stepped out from behind the bushes, its eyes bright with magic. The fox led Mira deep into the forest to a hidden lake that shone like liquid moonlight. As Mira held the feather above the lake, the water began to rise and form a towering spirit of the forest. The spirit thanked Mira and granted her a single wish for returning its lost feather.
